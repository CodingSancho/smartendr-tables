# Smartendr-KDS

## Overview

Kitchen display system, developed for a code challange. Layout design based on Lightspeed KDS.
Project initialized using Vite.
Built using React, TypeScript, and Material-UI with inline styling.

## Assumptions about the assignment

1) If a table name does not follow the format, we consider it accidental.
2) If an order has a quantity of 0, we filter it out.
3) The unexpected amount of orders is ignored, because we have no information about amount of people at the tables.
4) No tests were written, since it would be out of the scope of the assignment.
5) Perfect is the enemy of good.

## Features

- Header and tables to display orders of a restaurant, grouped by tables.
